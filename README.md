## Introduction

This is a SpatialOS starter project with useful core features that you can extend to build your own SpatialOS application.

It contains:

* A Player spawned on client connection as per the [Unity Client Lifecycle Guide](https://github.com/spatialos/UnitySDK/blob/master/docs/tutorials/recipes/client-lifecycle.md).
* A Cube spawned through a snapshot via an entity template method and an Unity prefab.
* The rest of the features included in the [BlankProject](https://github.com/spatialos/BlankProject).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

1. Clone of download a copy of the [SpatialOS Unity SDK](https://github.com/spatialos/UnitySDK/tree/v1.0.1).

### Building the project

2. Run `setup-unity-sdk.sh` and pass in the location of the Unity SDK (See Step 1 above) as the first argument.
E.g., `./setup-unity-sdk.sh "D:\UnitySDK"`

### Running the project

To run the project locally, first build it by running `spatial worker build`, then start the server with `spatial local start`. You can connect a client by opening the Unity project and pressing the play button, or by running `spatial local worker launch UnityClient default`. See the [documentation](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/deploy/deploy-local) for more details.

To deploy the project to the cloud, first build it by running `spatial worker build -t=deployment`, then upload the assembly with `spatial cloud upload <assembly name>`, and finally deploy it with `spatial cloud launch <assembly name> <launch configuration file> <deployment name> --snapshot=<snapshot file>`. You can obtain and share links to connect to the deployment from the [console](http://console.improbable.io/projects). See the [documentation](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/reference/13.0/shared/deploy/deploy-cloud) for more details.
